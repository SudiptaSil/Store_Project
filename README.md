# Store_Project


 A virtual store in which the shopper can view the inventory, and then choose what to buy. There is a cash register represented by a dictionary with different quantities of bills and coins. The shopper can also input the bills and coins used to pay and then will get back their change in bills and coins. The cash register updates each time the shopper pays or gets their change back.
